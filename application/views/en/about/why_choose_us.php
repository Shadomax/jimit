                           In terms of numbers, the growth forecast is staggering. In 2013, Internet penetration within the continent stood at 16%; by 2025, this is expected to have risen to 50%. This translates to a rise from 167 million Internet users in 2013 to an estimated 600 million users by 2025.

                            To put that into perspective, the online consumer market will roughly quadruple in size over the next 12 years. This equates to a rise in the Internetâ€™s contribution to GDP (iGDP) from $18 billion to $300 billion. Such rapid economic growth will inevitably increase global and domestic interest from companies looking to tap into the growth of new users and their online global brand preferences.
